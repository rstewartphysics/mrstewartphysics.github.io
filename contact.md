  <h2>Need help?</h2>
  <p>
    If you're stuck on homework, exam prep, or practical work:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Ask in class first — that’s always the best option.</li>
    <li>Bring your working so I can see what you’ve tried.</li>
    <li>Be specific: “I don’t get Question 4b” is better than “I don’t get physics.”</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>When I’m available</h2>
  <p>
    I can usually help before school or at lunchtime if I’m not in a meeting or running a practical.  
    Check with me in class to confirm a time.

  <h2>Equipment / practical safety</h2>
  <p>
    For Practical Electronics and Engineering Science:  
    Always follow workshop safety rules — no food/drink at benches, tie back long hair, and power down before changing components.
